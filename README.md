### Remove trailing whitespace
You can very easily delete all the trailing whitespace in a file by executing the **Delete Horizontal White Space** command
found in **Edit** -> **Advanced** or by using the shortcut key combination Ctrl+K, Ctrl+\

### Changing the background color
You can change the background color from the
**Tools -> Options** dialog under the
**Environment -> Fonts and Colors** settings.

The setting is for the *Text Editor* and the display
item is called *Trailing Whitespace*.

### Ignore rules
It's easy to add specify what file patterns to ignore. Any
ignored file will have whitespace colorized or removed
on save.

By default, file paths with any of the following strings
contained in it will be ignored:

- \node_modules\
- \bower_components\
- \typings\
- \lib\
- .min.
- .md
- .markdown
- .designer.

You can modify these rules in the **Tools -> Options** dialog.

### Remove on save
Every time a file is saved, all trailing whitespace is removed. This can be disabled in the
**Tools -> Options** dialog.
